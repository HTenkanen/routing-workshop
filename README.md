# Python Routing Workshop 

In this small routing workshop (held for DGL, Uni. Helsinki, 10th January 2020) we will go through different tools that can be used to analyze travel times and distances with Python. 

## Start by cloning/downloading this repo to your computer

`$ git clone https://github.com/HTenkanen/routing-workshop`

## Installations

Before starting with the actual materials, make sure that you have all required Python packages installed.

For installing the required packages, see separate [documentation here](env/README.md).

## Topics

We cover 4 different topics. Go through them in order.

 1. [What is out there? Tools for network analysis and routing with Python.](docs/routing-tools.ipynb)
 2. [Basics of routing - shortest paths by walking/cycling](docs/basics.ipynb)
 3. [Building custom graphs - Routing by car using Digiroad](docs/building_graphs.ipynb)
 4. [Public transport routing](docs/transit_routing.ipynb)
 5. [Example scripts for running OpenTripPlanner](docs/otp/README.md)
 
You can run all the examples by running Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your computer:

```
$ cd ../routing-workshop
$ jupyter lab
```
