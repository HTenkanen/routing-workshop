These two scripts can be used to:

 1. [Build an OTP transit graph](build_otp_graph.py)
 2. [Calculate one to many travel time matrices](one_to_many_otp.py)
 
Before running these tools, you need to have installed Java JDK 8 (Development Kit). You can download and install it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

For testing OTP, you can download example test data from [here](https://github.com/AccessibilityRG/HelsinkiRegionTravelTimeMatrix2018/tree/master/codes/tests/comparisons-against-Google-and-OTP/data) (download all files.)
